# Contributing

We love contributions! We've compiled this documentation to help you understand our
contributing guidelines. [If you still have questions, please contact us][email] and
we'd be happy to help!

## Code of Conduct

[Please read `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` before contributing][code-of-conduct].

## Getting started

To start contributing, first make sure your system meets these requirements:

1. Python 3.6.1+ installed
2. [`poetry` installed; see their documentation for instructions][poetry-install]

Then install the required Python packages, and Git pre-commit hooks using:

```shell
poetry run make dependencies
```

It is better to use the above `make` command, rather than `poetry install` and
`poetry run pre-commit install`. This `make` command will ensures your pre-commit hooks
are up-to-date with any changes made.

The pre-commit hooks are a security feature to ensure, for example, no secrets[^1], and
large data files, are accidentally committed into the repository. [For more information
on pre-commit hooks see our documentation][docs-pre-commit-hooks].

[^1]: [Only secrets of specific patterns are detected by the pre-commit
      hooks][docs-pre-commit-hooks-secrets-definition].

## Code conventions

[We mainly follow the GDS Way in our code conventions][gds-way].

### Git and GitHub

We use Git to version control the source code. [Please read the GDS Way for details on
Git best practice][gds-way-git]. This includes how to write good commit messages, use
`git rebase` for local branches and `git merge --no-ff` for merges, as well as using
`git push --force-with-lease` instead of `git push -f`.

[If you want to modify the `.gitignore` files, see the template
documentation][docs-updating-gitignore] for further details.

Our source code is stored on GitHub. Pull requests into `main` require at least one
approved review.

### Python

For Python code, [we follow the GDS Way Python style guide][gds-way-python] with a line
length of 88; the flake8 pre-commit hook should help with this!

### Markdown

Local links can be written as normal, but external links should be referenced at the
bottom of the Markdown file for clarity. For example:

```md
Use a local link to reference the [`README.md`](./README.md) file, but an external link
for [GOV.UK][gov-uk].

[gov-uk]: https://www.gov.uk/
```

We also try to wrap Markdown to a line length of 88 characters, but this is not
strictly enforced in all cases, for example with long hyperlinks.

## Testing

[Tests are written using the `pytest` framework][pytest], with its configuration in the
`pyproject.toml` file. Note, only tests in the `tests` folder are run. To run the
tests, enter the following command in your terminal:

```shell
pytest
```

### Code coverage

[Code coverage of Python scripts is measured using the `coverage` Python
package][coverage]; its configuration can be found in `pyproject.toml`. Note coverage
only extends to Python scripts in the `govuk_tech_docs_sphinx_theme` folder.

To run code coverage, and view it as an HTML report, enter the following command in
your terminal:

```shell
poetry run make coverage_html
```

The HTML report can be accessed at `htmlcov/index.html`.

## Documentation

[We write our documentation in MyST Markdown for use in Sphinx][myst]. This is mainly
stored in the `docs` folder, unless it's more appropriate to store it elsewhere, like
this file.

[Please read our guidance on how to write Sphinx
documentation][docs-write-sphinx-documentation], and build it into a searchable website.
