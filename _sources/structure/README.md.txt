## Top-level files

Each subsection here contains a brief description about the files at the top-level of
this Git repository.

### `.envrc`

A file containing environment variables for the Git repository that can be selectively
loaded. [`.envrc` uses the `direnv` shell extension to load these environment
variables][direnv].

This file contains a `sed` command to output a `.env` file with all the environment
variables. This may be useful for sourcing environment variables, for example in
conjunction with PyCharm's EnvFile plugin.

To ensure this `sed` command works correctly, make sure any file paths listed in this
file are absolute file paths (recommended). Relative file paths using other
environment variables only work for Python users. Environment variable names can
only contain letters, numbers or underscores as well. For example:

```shell
export DIR_DATA=$(pwd)/data                    # fine for Python and R users
export DIR_DATA_EXTERNAL=$(pwd)/data/external  # fine for Python and R users
export DIR_DATA_EXTERNAL=./data/external       # fine for Python and R users
export DIR_DATA_EXTERNAL=$DIR_DATA/external    # fine for Python users only
export DIR-DATA-EXTERNAL=$DIR_DATA/external    # will break the `sed` command!
```

### `.flake8`

A configuration file for the `flake8` Python package that provides linting. This file
is based on the [common configuration described in the GDS Way][gds-way-flake8].

### `.gitignore`

A `.gitignore` file to ignore certain files and folders from this Git repository. [See
the contributor guide to modift the `.gitignore` file][docs-updating-gitignore].

### `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

[A pre-commit hook configuration file][docs-pre-commit-hooks].

### `.secrets.baseline`

[Baseline file for the `detect-secrets` to detect secrets][detect-secrets]. In
conjunction with `pre-commit`, `detect-secrets` prevents secrets from being committed
to the repository. The baseline file flags secret-like data that the user deliberately
wishes to commit the to repository.

### `build_alphagov_tech_docs_template.sh`

A shell script to get a built version of the latest GOV.UK Tech Docs template; the
[contributor guide contains instructions to run this script][docs-theme-dev-shell].

### `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`

[The Code of Conduct for contributors to this project][code-of-conduct], including
maintainers and `ukgovdatascience` organisation owners.

### `conftest.py`

File to contain shared fixture functions for the `pytest` tests in the `tests` folder.
